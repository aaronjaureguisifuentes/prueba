<hr/>
<p>This is an implementation of a Unix shell interpreter interface.</p>
<small>the main objective of the project is to improve the understanding of the C language by collaborators, to become more familiar with the Unix Operating System, better called <b>Shell</b> so manage the greater complexity of the program </small>


<h2> What does our shell do? </h2>

<p>Is a command interpreter of an operating system </p>

<h3> Copilation and Usage </h3>
<p> git clone [Link Repository] </p>
<p> $gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o *hsh </p>
<p>./hsh</p>

<p>[Enter following the shell commands]</p>

<h3>Comands Description</h3>
<span> echo Holberton </span>
<p> In the above command, the echo command will write its Holberton argument to standard output.</p>
<p>Another command to execute in the hsh, in order to have a better interaction with the program, is the cd command, which allows us to change the directory and be able to view the different files that exist in it.</p>
<span>cd</span>
<p>In order to list the number of files that exist in our directory, we can use the following command:</p>
<span>ls</span>
